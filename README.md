# What is it?
This is a collection of some scripts/programs/etc. on Julia that I wrote for myself.
Eventually this may become a Navier-Stokes Discontinuous Galerkin solver on a moving
Voronoi meshes. Or maybe something else.

# Why?
For fun! And to educate myself.

# Why is it called Alice?
There is no any special meaning. Just the first name that came to mind.
